console.log("Hello World");



//Pseudocode for the What the Hell We've learned so Far Trivia Game//
//Create a Start button that starts the game.  The demo video shows the whole game is hidden until the start game button is pushed//




//Start function - Button with an on "click"



//Countdown Clock function - this function would also act as a game end function so that when the time reaches zero, the game stops, the guesses are tallied




//Create a Question function
//Create an Answers function - four choices that can be either radio dials or buttons.  I think I like buttons better//

//Create a way to replicate the question and answer function to offer more questions. 

//Correct answer function - fills in how many correct answers were guessed

//Incorrect answer function - fills in how many incorrect answers were guessed

//Unanswered function - tallies how many questions the user did not guess.
